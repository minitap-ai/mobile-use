</p>

### TL;DR

**What is it?** An AI agent to control your phone (IOS/Android) with natural language.

> **Note:** This quickstart, with everything dockerized, is only available for Android devices/emulators as of now.

**How to run?**

- Either plug your Android device and enable USB-debugging via the Developer Options
- Or launch an Android emulator

> **Note:** You must have Docker installed for this quickstart to work.

Then run in your terminal:

1. For Linux/macOS:

```bash
# At some point, Maestro will ask you `Maestro CLI would like to collect anonymous usage data to improve the product.`. It's up to you whether you accept (i.e enter 'Y') or not (i.e. enter 'n').
minitap.sh \
  "Open Gmail, find first 3 unread emails, and list their sender and subject line" \
  --output-description "A JSON list of objects, each with 'sender' and 'subject' keys"
```

2. For Windows (inside a Powershell terminal):

```powershell
# At some point, Maestro will ask you `Maestro CLI would like to collect anonymous usage data to improve the product.`. It's up to you whether you accept (i.e enter 'Y') or not (i.e. enter 'n').
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File minitap.ps1 `
  "Open Gmail, find first 3 unread emails, and list their sender and subject line" `
  --output-description "A JSON list of objects, each with 'sender' and 'subject' keys"
```

> **Note:** If using your own device, make sure to accept the ADB-related connection requests that will pop up on your device.
> Similarly, Maestro will need to install its APK on your device, which will also require you to accept the installation request.

## üí° What is mobile-use?

Mobile-use is a powerful, open-source AI agent that controls your Android or IOS device using natural language. It understands your commands and interacts with the UI to perform tasks, from sending messages to navigating complex apps.

![mobile-use in Action](./doc/linkedin-demo.gif)

## ‚ú® Features

- **Natural Language Control**: Interact with your phone using your native language.
- **UI-Aware Automation**: Intelligently navigates through app interfaces.
- **Data Scraping**: Extract information from any app and structure it into your desired format (e.g., JSON) using a natural language description.
- **Extensible & Customizable**: Easily configure different LLMs to power the agents that power mobile-use.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Ready to automate your mobile experience? Follow these steps to get mobile-use up and running.

### Quick Launch (Docker)

For the fastest way to get started, please see the [TL;DR](#tldr) section at the top of this document for a one-command Docker setup.

### Manual Launch (Development Mode)

For developers who want to set up the environment manually:

#### 1. Device Support

Mobile-use currently supports the following devices:

- **Physical Android Phones**: Connect via USB with USB debugging enabled.
- **Android Simulators**: Set up through Android Studio.
- **iOS Simulators**: Supported for macOS users.

> **Note**: Physical iOS devices are not yet supported.

#### 2. Prerequisites

For Android:
- **[Android Debug Bridge (ADB)](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools)**: A tool to connect to your device.

For iOS:
- **[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)**: Apple's IDE for iOS development.

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)**: A lightning-fast Python package manager.
- **[Maestro](https://maestro.mobile.dev/getting-started/installing-maestro)**: The framework we use to interact with your device.

#### 3. Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/mobile-use.git && cd mobile-use
    ```

2.  **Create & activate the virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    # This will create a .venv directory using the Python version in .python-version
    uv venv

    # Activate the environment
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source .venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows:
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Sync with the locked dependencies for a consistent setup
    uv sync
    ```

### 3. Configuration

1.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Copy the example `.env.example` file to `.env` and add your API keys. An OpenAI key is required for out-of-the-box functionality.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

2.  **(Optional) Customize LLM Configuration:**
    To use different models or providers, create your own LLM configuration file.
    ```bash
    cp llm-config.override.template.jsonc llm-config.override.jsonc
    ```
    Then, edit `llm-config.override.jsonc` to fit your needs.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Usage

To run mobile-use, simply pass your command as an argument.

**Example 1: Basic Command**

```bash
python ./src/minitap/main.py "Go to settings and tell me my current battery level"
```

**Example 2: Data Scraping**

Extract specific information and get it back in a structured format. For instance, to get a list of your unread emails:

```bash
python ./src/minitap/main.py \
  "Open Gmail, find all unread emails, and list their sender and subject line" \
  --output-description "A JSON list of objects, each with 'sender' and 'subject' keys"
```

> üí° **Note:** If you haven't configured a specific model, mobile-use will prompt you to choose one from the available options.
